Ajax add to cart for WooCommerce Single products

== Description ==

The default add to cart button of WooCommerce for single products reloads the entire site each time a product is added to the cart. The more steps and time your e-commerce load, the more you reduce the chances of selling.

[WooCommerce Ajax add to cart](https://quadmenu.com/add-to-cart-with-woocommerce-and-ajax-step-by-step/) allows users to include single products or variable products in the cart without the need to reload the entire site each time.
